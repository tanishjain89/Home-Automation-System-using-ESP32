# Home-Automation-System-using-ESP32
This project is a simple yet powerful Home Automation System built using an ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller and a 4-channel relay module. It allows users to control home appliances (like lights, fans, etc.) remotely over Wi-Fi using a web interface or mobile app.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller
- ✅ Control up to 4 appliances (lights, fans, etc.)
- ✅ Web-based interface hosted on ESP32
- ✅ Uses GPIO 23, 22, 21, and 19 for relay control
- ✅ Real-time switching of appliances
- ✅ Accessible via phone or PC over local Wi-Fi
- ✅ Low-cost solution for smart home automation
